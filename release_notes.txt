- Created new signing key for app build.
- Cleaned code and removed unused/commented code.
- Added comments to help explain the purpose of each activity/service.

- Removed hardcoded values that represent shared preferences keys or activity extra keys, and added them as enums for easier maintenance.
- Extracted all the hardcoded constants and created AppConsts class for them.
- Converted all the hardcoded size values that were used programmatically from DP to Pixel.
- Password texts are made discreet/secret now.

- Implemented weight validation starting from payment page, all the way to final page. if user adds extra weight to the cart, red led will display.
- Handled EEMC's failed requests.
- In API URL builder:
    * Merged ApiMethods with ApiUrl.
    * Added new operations for updating weight, retrieving tolerance, checking payment status, retrieving company details, and logging errors.
    * Fixed placing order base URL to take the inventory URL instead of SmartLife.
- In Scheduled service:
    * Implemented a receiver to receive battery consumption updates and feed the server with correct values.
    Previously, this was not the case and the battery level was always passed the same number when app first started.
    * Implemented service cleanup to clean the timer thread and broadcast.
- In Base activity:
    * Added a method that checks whether user chose english or arabic language.
    * Added a method that converts DP to Pixels.
    * Created two separate methods for making HTTP requests "makeHttpPostRequest" and "makeHttpGetRequest".
    * Added an overloading method for "makeHttpGetRequest" which takes the param and embeds it in the URL (for EEMC API calls).
    * Added "handleError" method which is called when the HTTP request fails.
    * Extracted common methods between activities and added them in Base activity.
- In Startup activity:
    * Added finish() command to end the activity. So when the user manages to press back, it will not take him to splashscreen.
- In Admin activity:
    * Implemented View.OnClickLister to better organize the code and remove redundant logic.
    * Disabled the diagnostics button and colored it grey.
- In Settings activity:
    * Added an extra field to store CMS URL.
    * Added a saving indicator.
    * Made the system setting panel scrollable.
    * Company ID was hardcoded. I fixed it and used the actually company id given by the api, or default to 5.
    * Removed the toast that says "Saved" because it was being called regardless whether cart registration were successful or not.
    * Overrode the methods "handleResponse" and "handleError" to show message saying whether cart registration is successful or not.
- In Scale activity:
    * Overrode "handleError" to show the error to the user.
    * Overrode "onDestroy" to clear up hardware dependencies by turning scanner off and closing ports.
    * Cleared error text when the reset button is clicked or when a barcode is scanned.
    * Removed lines in "handleResponse" and reset button click that will call command '7A' to the scale port.
    This is because it was causing an issue when reset is pressed and the scale is not empty. The base for the scale would go in negative.
    * Added a dedicated button called "Rebase Scale" to reset/rebase the empty scale back to zero if needed.
    This is by calling the commented lines (command '7A').
- In Reset orders activity:
    * Removed all the UI views and only kept the WebView.
    * Implemented the WebView so that it loads the URL saved in settings.
    * Added a loading spinner to give indication that the page is being loaded.
    * Cleared cache and cookies when activity is loaded and on activity destroy.
- In Page 2:
    * Removed hardcoded URL value and replaced it with the URL provided in settings.
- In Page 3:
    * Implemented a receiver to receive battery consumption updates and update battery image accordingly.
    This was not the case before. The battery image used to show same image when the page was opened,
    even after some time being passed on that screen and the battery has gone lower.
    * Modified button drawable to color with grey if the button is disabled.
    * Implemented View.OnClickLister to better organize the code and remove redundant logic.
    * Implemented fetching company details and tolerances to store them in shared preferences.
    This will happen when user chooses a language. If one of these prefixes are missing, the app will not proceed to the next page.
    * Added a loading spinner to give indication that there is still a pending request.
    * Added app version below SmartLife logo.
- In Page 4:
    * Implemented View.OnClickLister to better organize the code and remove redundant logic.
    * Fixed an issue with the UI, where text "(Optional)" was misplaced.
    * Added another text "(Optional)" to show below phone number.
    * Fixed a crash that happens if the user used the numbers pad before selecting any text field.
    * Previously, there was no way to go from this screen to the next if user entered membership number.
    Now an HTTP request is made to validate the number. if it's valid then the user will be directed to next page,
    otherwise a message will be displayed informing him the number is invalid.
    * A loading indicator is displayed when membership number is being validated.
    * The membership number was hardcoded. I fixed it and now it respects what the user enters.
    * Fixed the HTTP request for validating the shareholder. Now it added the membership number as part of the URL (shareholder/{number}).
    This was not the case before. The membership number was being passed in the body of the request.
    * Passed user phone number and membership number to the next activity as extras.
- In Page 5:
    * Implemented View.OnClickLister to better organize the code and remove redundant logic.
    * Fixed the logic of turning on and off the hardware according to activity's lifecycle.
    * Fixed a possible racing condition when verifying barcode's weight and waiting for its response.
    Rather than updating product index 0, I find the product that matches the result's barcode, then update its weight.
    * Added prefix check when product's barcode is being scanned rather than manually inserted.
    Previously, this was only handled when the user manually enters the barcode, and not when he uses the scanner.
    * Fixed a bug that would turn off the scanner when the app is put in the background then brought back to foreground.
    Now, when coming back to foreground, the app will switch the scanner back on.
    * Implemented logic to update each product's weight individually.
    * Changed the total cart weight check by excluding products with no server weights and that are not prefixed products.
    * Added the order to SmartLife before going to payment page.
    * Removed hardcoded URL value for Ads and replaced it with the URL provided in settings.
    * Fixed a bug that enabled the payment button when increment/decrement is clicked. Now, it remains disabled if error notification is displayed.
    * Handled weightless products.
    * Handled prefixed products.
    * Modified the algorithm regarding weight validation. Now, I check against tolerance values returned from server.
- In Page 6:
    * Uncommented the part where it takes user to KNet payment screen (page 7), rather than the final bill screen (page 8).
- In Page 7:
    * Changed the base URL from hardcoded one to the one saved in settings and removed the hardcoded params to use the actual values.
    * Implemented logic to check for payment status when page is in "Result".
    If payment is done successfully, I move on to page 8, otherwise, reload button will appear.
    * Added a reload button to reload the WebView if page failed to load or payment was unsuccessful or payment status request failed.
    * Added a loading spinner to give indication that the KNet page is being loaded.
- In Page 8:
    * Added membership ID, if exists, to the body of placing an order to coop.
    * Removed "finish" button.
    * Added padding to the invoice number so it can be prefixed with zeros of length 5.
    * Changed rating faces to vector typed images.
    * Clicking at a rating will only color the selected one. It used to take the user back to ads screen and end the purchase process.
    * Turned on light whether placing order request is successful or not.
    * Overrode "onDestroy" to clean up hardware dependencies by switching both light and scanner off.
    * Purchase process is considered done when the weight on the scale is less than 5 grams.
    This is the only way to move from this screen back to ads screen (page 2).
    * Changed the barcode URL from using a hardcoded one to the one stored in settings.
